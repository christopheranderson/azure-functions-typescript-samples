# "Real" sample

This attempts to mimic a "real" app where you'll have a few packages.

## Overview

This uses lerna to manage multiple packages

## Quick start

```shell
npm i
npm start
```

This will install dependencies in all the sub-modules, build the typescript for the Function App, and start both the client and the server.
