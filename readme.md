# Azure Functions TypeScript Samples

Just some TypeScript samples I've written to help folks

## Getting started

Make sure you have Node 10 installed and functions core tools for v2

```shell
npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools@core
```

## Scenarios

1. [Simple](./samples/simple)

   Bare bones sample showing off using `scriptFile` to reference files in a different build directory
2. [SPA](./samples/spa)

   Simple example to show starting a SPA side by side with a Function App
